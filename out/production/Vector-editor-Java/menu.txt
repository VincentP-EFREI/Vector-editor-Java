The usage of this program  couldn't be easier.
You can simply read the different options printed on the terminal.
It is like a menu where all options are corresponding to a capital letter
In order to select or execute an option, you just have to write the corresponding letter.
The program can also ask you to give numbers corresponding to the coordinates of points
or a radius to create a circle for example.
